# evolution-sim
A web app that simulates the natural selection of 2D lifeforms. 

## How it works
This app simulates three types of 2D circle lifeforms on a 2D plane using an HTML canvas. Each lifeform has their own genetic traits which determine
their speed, energy gain rate, etc. The three lifeforms types are Plant, Herbivore, and Carnivore. When each
lifeform gains enough energy, they will reproduce and spawn offspring. An offspring's genes have a small chance of mutating which slightly increase/decrease its strength.
Overtime, the lifeforms will evolve and adapt to their environment.
